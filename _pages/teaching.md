## University of California Water Academy - _UC Berkeley_
### Co-Instructor (Spring, 2024)
*	**Course Description**:
This course covers the historical, scientific, legal, and institutional aspects of water management in California, focusing on challenges like water provision for agriculture, urban areas, and ecosystems. The course included a week-long field tour, where we explored major water infrastructure sites such as Yosemite NP, Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, the Central Valley, and the Sacramento-San Francisco Bay Delta, along with a 3-day rafting trip on the Tuolumne River.
* **Audience**:
Open to students from UC campuses who are part of the COEQWAL project.

### [Introduction to Spatial Analysis for Environmental Sciences (ERTH 660)](https://catalog.csuchico.edu/courses/erth/) - _CSU Chico_
Instructor (Spring, 2026)
* **Course Description**: Foundational GIS for environmental applications—spatial data models (vector/raster), coordinate systems and projections, data acquisition/cleaning, cartography, and core spatial analyses (overlay, proximity, terrain). Hands-on labs using GIS tools with case studies from California watersheds.
* **Audience**: Broad undergraduate audience across ERTH/GEOG/ENVS and related majors; no prerequisites.
* **My Role**: Instructor—design syllabus and labs, lead lectures/discussions, and mentor team projects using open environmental datasets.

### [Introduction to Climate Change (ERTH 104)](https://catalog.csuchico.edu/courses/erth/)  - _CSU Chico_
Instructor (Spring, 2026)
* **Course Description**: Scientific basis of climate change—energy balance, greenhouse gases, observations and models, scenarios—and impacts on water resources, extreme events, ecosystems, and society. Emphasis on mitigation and adaptation, quantitative labs, and clear communication.
* **Audience**: Broad undergraduate audience across ERTH/GEOG/ENVS and related majors; no prerequisites.
* **My Role**: Instructor—deliver lectures and labs, guide discussions and a term project focused on California-relevant cases.

### [California Water Policy and Management](https://watermanagement.ucdavis.edu/californiawatercourse) - _UC Davis_
Course Coordinator (Fall, 2024 - Summer, 2025)
*	**Course Description**:
This course provides practical education on water science, management, and policy to residents, businesses, community water advocates, and entry-level professionals in California. The course will launch in November 2024, presented to the Water Program Team, a group of scientists addressing water issues in the state.
* **Audience**:
Open to residents, professionals, and advocates interested in water management in California.
* **My Role**:
As a course coordinator, I assist with developing course materials, organizing discussions, and coordinating logistics to ensure the effective delivery of the course content.

### [University of California Water Academy](https://live-coeqwal-ca.pantheon.berkeley.edu/uc-water-academy/) - _UC Berkeley_
Co-Instructor (Spring, 2024), (Winter, 2025)
*	**Course Description**:
This course covers the historical, scientific, legal, and institutional aspects of water management in California, focusing on challenges like water provision for agriculture, urban areas, and ecosystems. The course included a week-long field tour, where we explored major water infrastructure sites such as Yosemite NP, Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, the Central Valley, and the Sacramento-San Francisco Bay Delta, along with a 3-day rafting trip on the Tuolumne River.
* **Audience**:
Open to students from UC campuses who are part of the COEQWAL project.
* **My Role**:
As co-instructor, I led weekly virtual discussions with students and experts, covering California's water history, hydrologic systems, and management challenges. I co-led the student video project, where participants created 5-minute videos, which will be featured on the COEQWAL website.

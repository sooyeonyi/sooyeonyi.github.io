### Co-Instructor (Spring, 2024)
*	**Course Description**:
This course covers the historical, scientific, legal, and institutional aspects of water management in California, focusing on challenges like water provision for agriculture, urban areas, and ecosystems. The course included a week-long field tour, where we explored major water infrastructure sites such as Yosemite NP, Hetch Hetchy Reservoir, the Central Valley, and the Sacramento-San Francisco Bay Delta, along with a 3-day rafting trip on the Tuolumne River.
* **Audience**:
Open to students from all UC campuses.
* **My Role**:
As co-instructor, I led weekly virtual discussions with students and experts, covering California's water history, hydrologic systems, and management challenges. I co-led the student video project, where participants created 5-minute videos, which will be featured on the COEQWAL website.

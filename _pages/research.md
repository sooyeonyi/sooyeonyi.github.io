### Research Interests
* My research focuses on understanding the complex interactions between water, the environment, and human systems, with an emphasis on water resources management, climate change, riparian ecosystems, and risk assessment related to droughts and floods. I strive to develop innovative solutions—whether through physics-based models or data-driven approaches—that promote the sustainable management of water resources while enhancing the resilience of ecosystems and human systems.

### Research Agenda

### **1.	Surface Hydrology**
* I am interested in the dynamics of surface hydrology and the role of advanced modeling techniques in enhancing water management systems. My research focuses on streamflow prediction, flood management, and the impacts of human interventions such as dam removal on hydrological regimes. I explore how emerging tools like machine learning and deep learning algorithms can improve the accuracy of hydrologic forecasts, especially in ungauged basins. Additionally, I examine how land use changes and management practices influence water availability and ecosystem resilience.

Ongoing Projects:
1.	Enhancing flood control and water management efficiency: I am currently running models to optimize flood management strategies.
2.	Predicting streamflow in ungauged basins using deep learning algorithms: Ongoing work involves model development to forecast streamflow in data-scarce regions.
3.	Predicting flow regime alterations post-dam removal: I have applied a machine learning approach, incorporating land use and cover dynamics, to assess flow regime changes. This work is under review by Water Resources Management.
4.	Water resources management in the Apurímac River Basin: I employed a one-bucket model approach, and this project is in preparation for journal submission.

### **2.	Water Resources Management**
* I focus on developing and applying models to optimize water resources management, with a particular interest in reservoir operations, water allocation, and inter-basin transfers. My research spans the use of advanced optimization techniques and water evaluation models to address water supply challenges and improve energy efficiency in water transfer systems. These studies aim to enhance decision-making in water resource management, particularly in the context of hydropower reservoirs and regions facing water deficits.

### **3.	Ecosystem Management**
* My research in ecosystem management focuses on evaluating the effects of water management practices on environmental flows and fish populations, particularly in California’s Central Valley. As part of the COEQWAL project, I am investigating how water management scenarios and operational changes impact environmental flow targets and ecosystem health. The natural seasonal water flows in California’s rivers have been altered by dams, infrastructure, and land use changes, leading to habitat degradation and fish population decline. Through scenario planning, we are assessing how changes in water management could improve or hinder the sustainability of environmental flows, while balancing competing water demands.

2.	Environmental Planning in U.S. Inter-Basin Water Transfer Projects – _Under review by Frontiers of Environmental Science_.
3.	WEAPhish: Integrating water resources and fish population dynamics tools – _Manuscript under preparation_.

### **4.	Climate Change**
* My research in the area of climate change focuses on assessing the impacts of extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, on urban infrastructure and water management. I explore how climate change influences flood vulnerability, reservoir operations, and emergency response strategies, particularly in the context of extreme drought conditions. This research is aimed at developing models and strategies that enhance the resilience of water management systems in a changing climate.

2.	Development of a reservoir operation model determining the pre-release strategy for flood events – _Manuscript under preparation_.
3.	Assessment of activating reservoir emergency storage in climate-change-fueled extreme drought – [Published](https://doi.org/10.3390/w14203242).

### **5.	Machine Learning & Deep Learning**
* My research focuses on leveraging machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to improve forecasting and management in water resources. By integrating advanced computational techniques with hydrological data, I aim to enhance predictive models for flood forecasting, groundwater levels, and energy use in water transfer projects. These methods offer powerful tools to optimize water management operations and improve decision-making in a variety of hydrological contexts.

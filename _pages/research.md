## Postdoctoral Researcher (2024 - )
### Collaboratory for Equity in Water Allocations [COEQWAL](https://live-coeqwal-ca.pantheon.berkeley.edu/)
*	Explore how the Central Valleyâ€™s water management system performs under a wide range of operational alterations and climate futures. 
*	Assess how operational alternatives enable or hinder our ability to sustain environmental flows in Central Valley rivers, assessed in relation to natural, unpaired flows and to functional flow targets. 
*	Show that changes in the volumes and priorities of environmental flow requirements have substantial effects on other water management objectives, including water deliveries from the State Water Project and Central Valley Project and to Delta salinity dynamics.

### Improving predictions of streamflow in ungauged basins: Application of deep learning algorithms
*	Develops models to predict streamflow, using regionalization techniques for streamflow prediction in ungauged basins (PUB).
*	Predict streamflow in ungauged basins and to assess the impact of various meteorologic and topographic factors on these predictions. 
*	Develop more reliable and efficient streamflow prediction models using deep learning algorithms (Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)) and applied Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOOCV).

### Development of reservoir operation model determining the pre-release strategy for the flood events
*	Develop a reservoir operation model that helps reduce peak releases during the flood season.
*	Generate reference tables and graphs for determining target reservoir elevation after pre-release.
*	Propose practical applications for real-time decision-making.

### Enhancing flood control and water management efficiency
*	Develop dam discharge estimation model using machine learning. 
*	Apply Artificial Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) to address the excess oscillation in inflow data.

### Predicting flow regime alterations post-dam removal: A machine learning approach incorporating land use and cover dynamics
*	Develop flow duration curves using geostatistical and machine learning models for comparison.
*	Utilize kriging and cokriging in geostatistical methods, and employ RF, SVR, LSTM, and GRU in machine learning models.
*	Identify significant independent variables affecting low (Q80, Q90, Q95) medium (Q30, Q40, Q50, Q60, Q70), and high flow (Q10, Q20) conditions.

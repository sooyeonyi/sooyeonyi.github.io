## Postdoctoral Researcher (2024 - )
### Collaboratory for Equity in Water Allocations [COEQWAL](https://live-coeqwal-ca.pantheon.berkeley.edu/)
*	Explore how the Central Valleyâ€™s water management system performs under a wide range of operational alterations and climate futures. 
*	Assess how operational alternatives enable or hinder our ability to sustain environmental flows in Central Valley rivers, assessed in relation to natural, unpaired flows and to functional flow targets. 
*	Show that changes in the volumes and priorities of environmental flow requirements have substantial effects on other water management objectives, including water deliveries from the State Water Project and Central Valley Project and to Delta salinity dynamics.

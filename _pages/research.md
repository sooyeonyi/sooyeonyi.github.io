### Research Interests
* My research focuses on understanding the complex interactions between water, the environment, and human systems, with an emphasis on water resources management, climate change, riparian ecosystems, and risk assessment related to droughts and floods. I strive to develop innovative solutions—whether through physics-based models or data-driven approaches—that promote the sustainable management of water resources while enhancing the resilience of ecosystems and human systems.

### Research Agenda

### **1.	Surface Hydrology & Water Resources Management** 
* My research focuses on understanding surface hydrology and improving water resources management through advanced modeling techniques. I investigate streamflow prediction, flood management, and the effects of human interventions like dam removal on hydrological systems. I also apply machine learning and optimization models to enhance water management strategies, particularly in reservoir operations, water allocation, and inter-basin transfers. My work aims to address water supply challenges, improve energy efficiency, and support ecosystem resilience in response to land use changes and climate impacts.

### **2.	Ecosystem Management**
* My research in ecosystem management focuses on evaluating the effects of water management practices on environmental flows and fish populations, particularly in California’s Central Valley. As part of the COEQWAL project, I am investigating how water management scenarios and operational changes impact environmental flow targets and ecosystem health. The natural seasonal water flows in California’s rivers have been altered by dams, infrastructure, and land use changes, leading to habitat degradation and fish population decline. Through scenario planning, we are assessing how changes in water management could improve or hinder the sustainability of environmental flows, while balancing competing water demands.

### **3.	Climate Change**
* My research in the area of climate change focuses on assessing the impacts of extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, on urban infrastructure and water management. I explore how climate change influences flood vulnerability, reservoir operations, and emergency response strategies, particularly in the context of extreme drought conditions. This research is aimed at developing models and strategies that enhance the resilience of water management systems in a changing climate.

### **4.	Machine Learning & Deep Learning**
* My research focuses on leveraging machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms to improve forecasting and management in water resources. By integrating advanced computational techniques with hydrological data, I aim to enhance predictive models for flood forecasting, groundwater levels, and energy use in water transfer projects. These methods offer powerful tools to optimize water management operations and improve decision-making in a variety of hydrological contexts.

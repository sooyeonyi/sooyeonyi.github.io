M.S. Hydrology and Water Resources Management, University of California, Davis, 2016

B.S. Hydrology and Water Resources Management, University of California, Davis, 2013

Research Interests/ Specializations

Research Description
------
My research focuses on water resources management, particularly supporting decision-making in water infrastructure management. I have recently joined Grantham’s lab as a postdoctoral researcher, contributing to the [COEQWAL](https://live-coeqwal-ca.pantheon.berkeley.edu/) project. In this role, I am developing modeling scenarios that integrate environmental flow needs into California’s water management strategies. I hold both a B.S. and an M.S. in Hydrology and Water Resources Management from UC Davis. During my Ph.D. program in the Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning department at UC Berkeley, I worked at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. My passion lies in addressing critical issues at the intersection of water resources and environmental sustainability, particularly in the face of increasingly frequent and extreme weather events. I am deeply committed to advancing knowledge and implementing solutions in this vital field.

Create content & metadata
------
======
For site content, there is one markdown file for each type of content, which are stored in directories like _publications, _talks, _posts, _teaching, or _pages. For example, each talk is a markdown file in the [_talks directory](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/_talks). At the top of each markdown file is structured data in YAML about the talk, which the theme will parse to do lots of cool stuff. The same structured data about a talk is used to generate the list of talks on the [Talks page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks), each [individual page](https://academicpages.github.io/talks/2012-03-01-talk-1) for specific talks, the talks section for the [CV page](https://academicpages.github.io/cv), and the [map of places you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html) (if you run this [python file](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.py) or [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb), which creates the HTML for the map based on the contents of the _talks directory).

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the Academic Pages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.

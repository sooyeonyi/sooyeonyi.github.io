I am starting as an **Assistant Professor of Hydrology** in the **Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences (ERTH)** at **California State University, Chico** in **January 2026**.

I will be teaching two courses in Spring 2026:
* Introduction to Spatial Analysis for Environmental Sciences
* Introduction to Climate Change

I am actively **recruiting undergraduate and M.S. students** to join my research group in **Spring 2026**. At least one or two funded projects will be available — **stay tuned for announcements**!! If you are interested, please contact me using the information below.

* My research passion lies in addressing critical issues at the intersection of water, environment, and humans, particularly in the face of increasingly frequent and extreme weather events like floods and droughts. I am deeply committed to advancing knowledge and implementing solutions to water challenges that have regional, national, and global impact in this vital field.
* My approach involves identifying and modeling hydrologic changes—whether driven by human activity, climate shifts, or planetary factors—and developing solutions to water challenges using a combination of physics-based models (e.g., WEAP, HEC-ResSim) and data-driven techniques (e.g., machine learning and deep learning).
* I have recently joined [Grantham’s Lab](https://nature.berkeley.edu/granthamlab/) as a postdoctoral researcher and am part of [Berkeley Freshwater](https://nature.berkeley.edu/freshwater/), contributing to the Collaboratory for Equity in Water Allocations [COEQWAL](https://live-coeqwal-ca.pantheon.berkeley.edu/) project. In this role, I am developing modeling scenarios that integrate environmental flow needs into California’s water management strategies. I am also currently serving as a Community and Culture Committee Co-Chair at the [Berkeley Postdoctoral Association](https://postdoc.berkeley.edu/about-us).
* I hold a Ph.D. in Environmental Planning with a focus on Hydrology and Water Resources Management from UC Berkeley. I also hold both a B.S. and an M.S. in Hydrology and Water Resources Management from UC Davis.

* My research focuses on water resources management, particularly supporting decision-making in water infrastructure management. I have recently joined Grantham’s lab as a postdoctoral researcher, contributing to the The Collaboratory for Equity in Water Allocations [COEQWAL](https://live-coeqwal-ca.pantheon.berkeley.edu/) project. In this role, I am developing modeling scenarios that integrate environmental flow needs into California’s water management strategies.
* I hold a Ph.D. in Environmental Planning with a focus on Hydrology and Water Resources Management from UC Berkeley. I also hold both a B.S. and an M.S. in Hydrology and Water Resources Management from UC Davis.
* My passion lies in addressing critical issues at the intersection of water resources and environmental sustainability, particularly in the face of increasingly frequent and extreme weather events. I am deeply committed to advancing knowledge and implementing solutions in this vital field.

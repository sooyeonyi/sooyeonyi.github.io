Research Description
------
My research focuses on water resources management, particularly supporting decision-making in water infrastructure management. I have recently joined Grantham’s lab as a postdoctoral researcher, contributing to the [COEQWAL](https://live-coeqwal-ca.pantheon.berkeley.edu/) project. In this role, I am developing modeling scenarios that integrate environmental flow needs into California’s water management strategies. I hold both a B.S. and an M.S. in Hydrology and Water Resources Management from UC Davis. During my Ph.D. program in the Landscape Architecture and Environmental Planning department at UC Berkeley, I worked at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. My passion lies in addressing critical issues at the intersection of water resources and environmental sustainability, particularly in the face of increasingly frequent and extreme weather events. I am deeply committed to advancing knowledge and implementing solutions in this vital field.

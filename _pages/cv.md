Education
======
* Ph.D in Environmental Planning, University of California, Berkeley (2022)
* M.S. in Hydrology and Water Resrouces Management, University of California, Davis (2016)
* B.S. in Hydrology and Water Resrouces Management, University of California, Davis (2013)  

Research experience
======
* Postdoctoral Researcher (2024 - ) | University of California, Berkeley
* Researcher (2022-2023) | University of California, Berkeley
* Graduate Student Reseracher (2017 - 2022) | University of California, Berkeley & Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
  
Research Interests
======
* My research focuses on understanding the complex interactions between water, the environment, and human systems, with an emphasis on water resources management, climate change, riparian ecosystems, and risk assessment related to droughts and floods. I strive to develop innovative solutions—whether through physics-based models or data-driven approaches—that promote the sustainable management of water resources while enhancing the resilience of ecosystems and human systems.

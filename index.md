### Join our Hydrology and Water Resources Management Lab Lab (Spring 2026)
The Hydrology and Water Resources Management Lab Lab at the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences (ERTH) in the College of Natural Sciences, California State University, Chico, studies environmental hydrology and water resources management with emphasis on environmental flows, sustainable allocation, and climate adaptation. We combine physics-based models (e.g., WEAP, HEC-ResSim), GIS/remote sensing, and data-driven methods (ML/DL) to understand change and support decision-making. Students can expect regular mentorship, hands-on modeling experience, and opportunities to contribute to publishable research. If this sounds like a fit, please use the short form below to share a paragraph about your interests and background.
